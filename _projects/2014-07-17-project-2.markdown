description: Blink is an adventure game that players can switch between virtual and augmented reality by using the quick switch function of Leap Motion. Unlike some of other games, where players can only be in either virtual or augmented reality, Blink allows players to switch back and forth between the virtual world and the environment they are currently in. Blink is greatly inspired by the Doctor Who episode Blink and Inception. It brings a new experience to players by combining the two realities with a theme of dream.
