description: Blink is a mixed reality adventure game. Switching between augmented reality and virtual reality is a key aspect of the game.  Players can explore the virtual world(the dreamscape). Through their exploration they will encounter vicious creatures(nightmares). Players need to wake up(augmented reality) and conquer their nightmares. Blink is greatly inspired by the Doctor Who episode Blink and Inception.
